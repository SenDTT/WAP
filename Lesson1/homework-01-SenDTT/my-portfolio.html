      About me paragraph (500 words):
      <p>
        My name is Thi Thanh Sen Doan, I was born in 1997 and am from Vietnam. I
        am so grateful because I live in an environment surrounded by love,
        support, and encouragement from my parents and siblings. They taught me
        the values of hard work, patience, and the importance of education.
        These values have guided me through various stages of my life, shaping
        who I am today. I love and miss my family so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        In high school, I was excited about the subject of information
        technology when we studied the Pascal language. My love for this subject
        led me to pursue a degree in computer science, where I gained a solid
        foundation in programming, algorithms, and software development. Over
        the years, I have worked as a full-stack PHP web developer, honing my
        skills in both front-end and back-end development. This role has
        provided me with invaluable experience in building and managing web
        applications, collaborating with teams, and solving complex problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the big decisions of my life was to relocate to the United States
        and pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science at Maharishi
        International University (MIU). The graduate program at MIU is a
        stepping stone for me to achieve my personal and professional goals. I
        will upgrade my skills to expand my knowledge in the field and reach new
        levels in my career in the future. My personal goals for the graduate
        program extend beyond academics. Additionally, I aim to improve my
        English communication skills, particularly in listening and speaking, as
        this has been a challenge for me despite years of study.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an introverted person, moving out of my comfort zone is one of the
        greatest personal challenges of my life and will change my mind. This
        will open a new chapter in my life. In conclusion, I am deeply grateful
        for the support of my family and the opportunities that have come my
        way. I feel both excited and nervous about the upcoming challenges in
        the new country, with many smart people from around the world and the
        knowledge at MIU.

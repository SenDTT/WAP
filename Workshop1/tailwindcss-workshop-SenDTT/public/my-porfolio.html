            <h5 class="my-heading">About me</h5>
            <p>
              My name is Thi Thanh Sen Doan, I was born in 1997 and am from
              Vietnam. I am so grateful because I live in an environment
              surrounded by love, support, and encouragement from my parents and
              siblings. They taught me the values of hard work, patience, and
              the importance of education. These values have guided me through
              various stages of my life, shaping who I am today. I love and miss
              my family so much.
            </p>
            <p>
              In high school, I was excited about the subject of information
              technology when we studied the Pascal language. My love for this
              subject led me to pursue a degree in computer science, where I
              gained a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and software
              development. Over the years, I have worked as a full-stack PHP web
              developer, honing my skills in both front-end and back-end
              development. This role has provided me with invaluable experience
              in building and managing web applications, collaborating with
              teams, and solving complex problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the big decisions of my life was to relocate to the United
              States and pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science at
              Maharishi International University (MIU). The graduate program at
              MIU is a stepping stone for me to achieve my personal and
              professional goals. I will upgrade my skills to expand my
              knowledge in the field and reach new levels in my career in the
              future. My personal goals for the graduate program extend beyond
              academics. Additionally, I aim to improve my English communication
              skills, particularly in listening and speaking, as this has been a
              challenge for me despite years of study.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an introverted person, moving out of my comfort zone is one of
              the greatest personal challenges of my life and will change my
              mind. This will open a new chapter in my life. In conclusion, I am
              deeply grateful for the support of my family and the opportunities
              that have come my way. I feel both excited and nervous about the
              upcoming challenges in the new country, with many smart people
              from around the world and the knowledge at MIU.

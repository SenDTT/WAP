### CS472-Workshop-Tailwindcss
The goal of this workshop is to learn the fundamentals of [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). 
* I will demo how to setup/install tailwindcss, and go over some essential utility classes, and teach you the layout classes for `grid`, `flex`, and `position`.
  
Students learn and finish the workshop assignment as follows:
1. Learn the essential utility classes by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZMUgga6SsY&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gpXORlEHjc5bgnIi5HEGhw&index=2), try to watch the full tutorial first, take notes, and then try to implement what you learned.
2. Refactor Homework 01 portfolio to use tailwind.
3. Refactor Homework 02 layout exercises to use tailwind, including the responsive layout.
4. Submit/push your refactored code by the end of the day 9 PM.
  
I'm available to answer any questions between 10:00 AM to noon, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. When you finish, explore [tailwind components](https://tailwindui.com/?ref=top) and [templates](https://www.tailwindawesome.com/?price=free&type=template).

Happy Styling!

Exercise 01
1. Explain the difference between primitive types and object references in JavaScript.
- primitive types: passed by value and Immutable. These include number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, and bigint.
It means their values cannot be changed once assigned. 

- object references: passed by reference, not Immutable by default and Shallow or Deep copy. 
These include objects like arrays, functions, and other complex data structures.
It means variables store a reference to the same memory location.

2. What are the advantage for using TypeScript?
- Typescript offers static typing, which helps catch errors at compiler time, making code more reliable.

3. How can we run TypeScript code in the browser?
- We should use compiler `tsc` transpile .ts files to .js files, then including .js files into .html to run in the browser.

4. What are the differences between `let` and `const`? and what is their scope?
- `let` and `const` are both block-scoped.
- `let` allows variable reassignment.
- `const` prevents reassignment but allows mutation in objects or arrays.

5. What is an IIFE and write a snippet code for one.
An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.

(function() {
    console.log("This is an example for an IIFE");
})();
